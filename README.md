# Token with Supply Cap

## Project Description

This smart contract implements a token system with maximum supply limits and controlled minting functionality on the Aptos blockchain. The contract ensures that the total token supply never exceeds a predefined maximum limit, providing scarcity and controlled inflation mechanisms. Only the contract owner has the authority to mint new tokens, ensuring centralized control over token creation while maintaining transparency through blockchain immutability.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a robust and secure token infrastructure that addresses the common issues of unlimited token supply and uncontrolled inflation. By implementing strict supply caps and controlled minting mechanisms, we aim to:

- **Preserve Value**: Ensure token scarcity through hard-coded supply limits
- **Prevent Inflation**: Control token creation to maintain economic stability
- **Ensure Security**: Implement owner-only minting to prevent unauthorized token creation
- **Provide Transparency**: Leverage blockchain technology for complete transaction visibility
- **Enable Trust**: Build confidence through immutable smart contract rules

This project serves as a foundation for creating stable, valuable digital assets that can be used in various DeFi applications, gaming ecosystems, or as utility tokens for specific platforms.

## Key Features
